# LionSoraCompanions

Adds Pride Lands Donald and Goofy as Soras Allies Everywehre. 

Do not use limits involving Goofy in timless river (his two limits and group trinity) they crash but All Other limits are Fine. Also only switch donald in or out from your party if it is a forced menu or sora is solo (party members are roaming around)it will crash otherwise. Do not switch donalds weapon if he is in your party/you are not in Pride Lands it will crash.
